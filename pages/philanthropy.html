                <h2 style="color: #efaa00; ">About the project</h2>

                <p> As per the direction and guidance received from <a
                        href="https://www.facebook.com/Suranga-Udaya-Kumara-427841701356972/" target="_blank">Suranga
                        Udayakumara</a> , the founder of the "Soduru
                    Hadawath"(Beautiful Hearts)
                    movement, as well as through the generous contributions
                    received from friends and families, I managed to get involved in setting
                    up a Tube well to a remote villege in Kebithigollewa, Anurdhapura, Sri Lanka.</p>

                <p> It is estimated that the project would signficiantly uplift the livelihood of more than 85
                    families
                    as previously they had to walk, on average, 2-3kms on a daily basis to collect water-The
                    pictures
                    show
                    how deligted these poor villegers were knowing that their wishes were getting fullfilled.
                    The severe drought weather conditions that is typically seen in these parts of island has
                    further
                    agrevated these conditions.
                    It is also estimated that the tube well would supply approximatly 3,000-4,000 litres of
                    water,
                    daily, to these villegers.

                <p>While we were visiting the villege, we also met this child and his mother (as shown in images
                    3
                    and
                    4) where the child has been disabled
                    since birth unable to walk.
                    As per the mother the kid has succumbed to this situation due to folic acid
                    deficiencies, a
                    deficincy that many of the villegers suffer due to the lack in the quality of water they
                    consume. Hope projects of this nature will provide, at minimum, some relief to these poor
                    villegers
                    to
                    enjoy a healthy life free from such misforuntues.

                    <p>
                        In addition to the above, I also got involved in donating a wheelchair to a poor mother
                        in the villege.

                <p>Through donations received from my good friend Adeline and her friends from France, managed
                    to
                    give
                    some relief to these poor villegers in rural areas in Sri lanka by supplying dry rations.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to arranging the above donations, I also had the opportunity to get some
                    first-hand
                    experiences of the dire conditions
                    under which these villegers are living. </p>

                <p> Hopefully, we will find more sponsors like Adeline to support families to provide them with
                    better
                    livelihoods
                    and living conditions. </p>

                    <p>We left Colombo early morning to reach a town called Kekirwa, a town 180kms from the city of
                        Colombo
                        in the north-central province of Sri Lanka, where we were coridally welcomed by a crowd of
                        villegers. These poverty-stricken villegers (approximately 50 families) were specificially
                        selected
                        from the surronding villeges like Gonapathirawa, Yaya 7, Yaya 9, Dummalawewwa, Ipologama as they
                        were adversely affected due to a sudden loss of a breadwinner in their families. These families
                        were
                        provided with dry ration parcels and the donations for the event was coordinated by a generous
                        group
                        of students. </p>

                    <p>I was introduced to this mother(see below) who lost her husband few weeks ago due to a tragic
                        lorry
                        accident.
                        She was weeping tears telling us about her situation as she now has to face difficulties to look
                        after
                        her two
                        kids with one kid just being one and half month old! The lost of her husband is a big loss for
                        the
                        family as he has been the main breadwinner for the family. I got involved in providing them with
                        dry
                        rations sufficient for few months giving a slight relief to this poor mother. Suranga, my
                        partner,
                        made a clip of the family to be shared in social media to find a suitable party to request for a
                        monthly scholorship for the kids. </p>

                        mother, the Kids were sleeping on
                        floor as they had to dispose the mattress their mother was sleeping after her infection. My good
                        friend, Keshan De Silva, genrously supported to provide them with a new mattress and pile of
                        pillows. Although small in
                        size, these actions always leaves me with a great sense of happiness and purpose.

                    <p>We were now litterly starving to death as it was well pass noon; The scorching heat too was
                        making
                        a heavy toll on us.
                        After having our meals in lotus leafs, we quickly moved to the next event - opening of the Tube
                        well
                        to the villegers in Kabthigollawa. The images below show how exciting the villegers were to
                        welcome
                        us “In my own lifetime this is the first time that I am seeing running water from a tap. I’m so
                        happy. I no longer have to tread nearly three to four kilometers of road to fetch water,” says
                        a villeger her voice choked with emotions. Until now, she and other villegers had to repeat
                        their trips to fetch water up to three times a day. </p>

                    <p> The day was almost approaching the sunset and we drove ourselves to this home of mentally
                        disabled
                        children in Anuradhapura.
                        We spent the late evening with them and offered them dinner and distributed clothes. The moments
                        I
                        had
                        with them were extremely heartfelt where I often wondered what their lives was without parents,
                        without love
                        and without someone to guide them. Seeing those children, with sporadic
                        resources, made me appreciate the copious amounts of things we had and sometimes, took for
                        granted.

                    <p>The day was almost coming to an end where we were finally on our way to meet Madura in Mihintale,
                        the
                        kid who we met during our last visit who was born paralyzed unable to walk. We were able to
                        arrange
                        the kid a monthly scholarship for his education and also offered them help to find medical
                        assitance. Madura was delighed to see us at his place and seeing his smile I realized something
                        very
                        important about myself - the feeling of sharing and giving joy gives me a feeling of elation.

                <h1>Project Name: School Supplies</h1>
                <h5>Project Location: Maha Vilachchiya - Anuradhapura District - Sri Lanka</h5>
                <h5>Project Date: 08 Nov 2019</h5>

                <p> It was my fourth visit to the district of Anuraphaura during this year 2019 and this time I was
                    traveling with my good friend Tharaka. All the events that we were planning to attend during
                    this particular day were organized by Suranga Udayakumara , the founder of the "Soduru
                    Hadawath"(Beautiful Hearts) movement.</p>

                <br>

                <p>

                    <a href="images/philanthropy-08112019/large/2.JPG"
                        data-lightbox="philanthropy-school-08112019-gallery">
                        <img src="images/philanthropy-08112019/thumbnails/2.JPG" alt="alt text" style="float: left">
                    </a>

                    It was through my brother that I was first introduced to Suranga and ever since our very first
                    meeting
                    in July 2019, I was able to build a close relationship with Suranga that had enabled me to
                    understand
                    some of the worst hardships that these poor communities in Sri Lanka are undergoing. As per
                    Suranga,
                    since the start of his movement about two and a half years ago, he had collected more than 100Mn
                    Sri
                    Lankan Rupees (Approx 560k USD) into various social projects primarily through his foundation's
                    Facebook
                    page - not an easy feat by any standards. What is even
                    more
                    inspiring is that he still continues to use a basic Nokia mobile phone to coordinate this gamut
                    of
                    work
                    and yet making certain that these mega projects are delivered as smoothly as possible. Suranga
                    was
                    born
                    to a poor family in the district of Anuradhapura in Sri lanka where at the tender age of 5 he
                    had to
                    face an unfortunate injury where he had lost all the toes of his right foot from a burn thus
                    causing
                    him
                    difficulties in walking. Despite all this misfortunes he had to face since childhood, Suranga
                    had
                    not
                    given up on his hopes and today he is working as an associate engineer for a road construction
                    company
                    in the District of Galle in Sri Lanka. Going beyond personal accomplishments, Suranga continues
                    to
                    amaze
                    and motivate me by his sheer passion and dedication towards supporting and uplifting the poor
                    communities in Sri Lanka. When asked if he ever wishes to get in to Sri Lankan Politics, Suranga
                    with
                    his humble smile replies me by saying, "No Sir, my only motivation is to really help these poor
                    people
                    and to bring a smile to their faces."

                <br>

                <p>
                    We left pretty early in the morning in order for us to be on time to attend the first event
                    which
                    was a donation of school supplies to 100 selected students from the surrounding areas of
                    Kuda-Halmillawa in Maha-Villachiya in the Anuradhapura District. During the previous week, I met
                    with Suranga in Pettah, Colombo's biggest, most chaotic and crowded market space, spending our
                    morning hours sorting the purchasing of the school bags at highly concessionary prices from the
                    generous funds we received from Tharka De Alwis. The children were primarily selected as they
                    had
                    lost either or both their parents thus were facing difficulty in finding sufficient means to
                    sponsor
                    for their school supplies. The smiles of these children shows how delighted and excited they
                    were to
                    welcome us and receive their school packs. On our way to the next event, I was also told by
                    Suranga
                    that the one of the biggest issues these villagers face beyond poverty is the risk of wild
                    elephant
                    attacks - although one could see electric fences planted around these villages, elephants
                    continue
                    to destroy these fences and invade the villages.

                    As almost all the donation events for this year were carried out in the District of
                    Anuradhapura, I felt the need do some research in order to provide some context about this area
                    to my readers. The District of Anuradhapura is situated in the North Central Province (NCP) of
                    Sri Lanka and carry with itself some of the most important historical aspects of Sri Lanka.
                    Anuradhapura District was the first capital of Sri Lanka and is divided into 22 Divisional
                    Secretary Divisions as illustrated in the map. With a Population of 856,399 as per the latest
                    census of population and housing in Sri Lanka, Anuradhapura District has a poor population of
                    33,140 which accounts for a poverty head count index(HCI) of 3.8 - A ratio that does not appear
                    to be alarming when compared to the national HCI average of 4.1. The area is also dominated by
                    farmers with a heavy focus on paddy cultivation and other cash and catch crops such as Chiles,
                    Onions, Ground nuts, Soya beans, Green gram, Cow pea, Sweet Corn and many dry zone crops and
                    vegetables.

                    Our next visit was to a home for mentally challenged children in the city of Anurdhapura. As per the
                    keepers of this home, the home hosts more than 30 children at any given time and receives a nominal
                    amount from the government but this amount seems rarely sufficient to provide a reasonable service
                    to these children. I was also told that as these children are mentally disabled, they tend to get
                    sick quite frequently and hence requires continuous medical attention. But using public transport to
                    get them to the nearest medical provider is an obstacle as it's not common that a bus driver or a
                    trishaw driver would accommodate a need for a children in this state of mind due to the possible
                    menace they would cause to the fellow passengers or to them. The keepers envisage if the home could
                    find some sponsorship's to buy a trishaw -  even a used one - that this could possibly bring a lot
                    of relief to the children as well as to the keepers of this home.

                    As the day was almost approaching dusk, we were finally heading to our final stop for the day to
                    meet Ram Mama and his family in Parasangaswewa which was just 20 Kms from the Anurdhapura town. Ram
                    Mama had apparently carried water to the whole village for many years before finally the village had
                    water flowing from their taps but now standing in front of us, Ram Mama appeared sick and feeble
                    unable to even to take care of his own family. Suranga had made arrangements to provide Rama Mama
                    and his family with a couple of mattresses but the main purpose of the visit was to make a short
                    video
                    clip to be published in Facebook to pledge for donations to build a small house to Rama Mama and his
                    family.

                    On my way to Colombo, despite feeling that extreme fatigue and exhaustion, I was feeling highly
                    energized with extreme feelings of deep happiness and excitement that I could never imagine that I
                    would get through any material successes - a feeling that one would typically get by knowing that
                    they had carried out a deeper responsibility as a human being by unconditionally and sincerly helping and
                    uplifting another human being.
