            <h1>Project Name: Support Mentally Challenged Children</h1>
            <h5>Project Location: Maha Vilachchiya - Anuradhapura District - Sri Lanka</h5>
            <h5>Project Date: 08 Nov 2019</h5>

            <br>

            <p> It was my fourth visit to the district of Anuraphaura during this year 2019 and this time I was
                traveling with my good friend Tharaka. All the events that we were planning to attend during
                this particular day were organized by Suranga Udayakumara , the founder of the "Soduru
                Hadawath"(Beautiful Hearts) movement.</p>

            <br>

            <p>

                <a href="../images/philanthropy-08112019/large/2.JPG" data-lightbox="philanthropy-school-08112019">
                    <img src="../images/philanthropy-08112019/thumbnails/2.JPG" alt="alt text" style="float: left">
                </a>

                It was through my brother that I was first introduced to Suranga and ever since our very first
                meeting
                in July 2019, I was able to build a close relationship with Suranga that had enabled me to
                understand
                some of the worst hardships that these poor communities in Sri Lanka are undergoing. As per
                Suranga,
                since the start of his movement about two and a half years ago, he had collected more than 100Mn
                Sri
                Lankan Rupees (Approx 560k USD) into various social projects primarily through his foundation's
                Facebook
                page - not an easy feat by any standards. What is even
                more
                inspiring is that he still continues to use a basic Nokia mobile phone to coordinate this gamut
                of
                work
                and yet making certain that these mega projects are delivered as smoothly as possible. Suranga
                was
                born
                to a poor family in the district of Anuradhapura in Sri lanka where at the tender age of 5 he
                had to
                face an unfortunate injury where he had lost all the toes of his right foot from a burn thus
                causing
                him
                difficulties in walking. Despite all this misfortunes he had to face since childhood, Suranga
                had
                not
                given up on his hopes and today he is working as an associate engineer for a road construction
                company
                in the District of Galle in Sri Lanka. Going beyond personal accomplishments, Suranga continues
                to
                amaze
                and motivate me by his sheer passion and dedication towards supporting and uplifting the poor
                communities in Sri Lanka. When asked if he ever wishes to get in to Sri Lankan Politics, Suranga
                with
                his humble smile replies me by saying, "No Sir, my only motivation is to really help these poor
                people
                and to bring a smile to their faces."
            </p>



            <br>

            <p>
                We left pretty early in the morning in order for us to be on time to attend the first event
                which
                was a donation of school supplies to 100 selected students from the surrounding areas of
                Kuda-Halmillawa in Maha-Villachiya in the Anuradhapura District. During the previous week, I met
                with Suranga in Pettah, Colombo's biggest, most chaotic and crowded market space, spending our
                morning hours sorting the purchasing of the school bags at highly concessionary prices from the
                generous funds we received from Tharka De Alwis. The children were primarily selected as they
                had
                lost either or both their parents thus were facing difficulty in finding sufficient means to
                sponsor
                for their school supplies. The smiles of these children shows how delighted and excited they
                were to
                welcome us and receive their school packs. On our way to the next event, I was also told by
                Suranga
                that the one of the biggest issues these villagers face beyond poverty is the risk of wild
                elephant
                attacks - although one could see electric fences planted around these villages, elephants
                continue
                to destroy these fences and invade the villages.

                As almost all the donation events for this year were carried out in the District of
                Anuradhapura, I felt the need do some research in order to provide some context about this area
                to my readers. The District of Anuradhapura is situated in the North Central Province (NCP) of
                Sri Lanka and carry with itself some of the most important historical aspects of Sri Lanka.
                Anuradhapura District was the first capital of Sri Lanka and is divided into 22 Divisional
                Secretary Divisions as illustrated in the map. With a Population of 856,399 as per the latest
                census of population and housing in Sri Lanka, Anuradhapura District has a poor population of
                33,140 which accounts for a poverty head count index(HCI) of 3.8 - A ratio that does not appear
                to be alarming when compared to the national HCI average of 4.1. The area is also dominated by
                farmers with a heavy focus on paddy cultivation and other cash and catch crops such as Chiles,
                Onions, Ground nuts, Soya beans, Green gram, Cow pea, Sweet Corn and many dry zone crops and
                vegetables.

            <p>
                Our next visit was to a home for mentally challenged children in the city of Anurdhapura. As per the
                keepers of this home, the home hosts more than 30 children at any given time and receives a nominal
                amount from the government but this amount seems rarely sufficient to provide a reasonable service
                to these children. I was also told that as these children are mentally disabled, they tend to get
                sick quite frequently and hence requires continuous medical attention. But using public transport to
                get them to the nearest medical provider is an obstacle as it's not common that a bus driver or a
                trishaw driver would accommodate a need for a children in this state of mind due to the possible
                menace they would cause to the fellow passengers or to them. The keepers envisage if the home could
                find some sponsorship's to buy a trishaw -  even a used one - that this could possibly bring a lot
                of relief to the children as well as to the keepers of this home.

                As the day was almost approaching dusk, we were finally heading to our final stop for the day to
                meet Ram Mama and his family in Parasangaswewa which was just 20 Kms from the Anurdhapura town. Ram
                Mama had apparently carried water to the whole village for many years before finally the village had
                water flowing from their taps but now standing in front of us, Ram Mama appeared sick and feeble
                unable to even to take care of his own family. Suranga had made arrangements to provide Rama Mama
                and his family with a couple of mattresses but the main purpose of the visit was to make a short
                video
                clip to be published in Facebook to pledge for donations to build a small house to Rama Mama and his
                family.

                On my way to Colombo, despite feeling that extreme fatigue and exhaustion, I was feeling highly
                energized with extreme feelings of deep happiness and excitement that I could never imagine that I
                would get through any material successes - a feeling that one would typically get by knowing that
                they had carried out a deeper responsibility as a human being by unconditionally and sincerly helping
                and
                uplifting another human being.
