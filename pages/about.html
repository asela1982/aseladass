                <p>Data Analyst with experience in deploying full-stack web applications using Python, JS, and SQL. I'm interested
                    in visualizing, coding, exploring, and learning.</p>

                <p>I am presently living in Austin, USA pursing a program in Data Analytics and Visualization at the University
                    of Texas, Austin. </p>

                <p>I was introduced to Data Analytics in 2013 when I was employed at
                    <a href="https://www.nationstrust.com/">Nations Trust Bank</a> in Sri Lanka. One of my primary responsibilities was to establish a Tableau center
                    of excellence to derive meaningful insights by visualizing the bank's data. Having had several years
                    of experience working in Microsoft Excel and Access, I felt obsessed about Tableau and so did the whole
                    bank. </p>

                <p>As more and more people started using Tableau, the demand for Data Analytics grew. This is when I finally
                    decided to take a ticket to USA, the hub for high-tech innovation and scientific development, to further
                    enhance my Analytical skills. It was a tough decision to quit my job and say adios to my parents, but
                    I guess life is all about taking tough decisions for what you truly like to do. </p>

                <p>Apart from reading for the program at UT, I maintain a
                    <a href="https://medium.com/me/stories/public">technical</a> blog in medium to share my experiences in Data Analytics. In general, I prefer tools that
                    are used in the journalism scene like
                    <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and are open-source. I also make every effort to improve my statistical thinking skills.I am
                    a bit of a perfectionist and hence I have a collection of technical books to dive into if I encounter
                    a snag along the way. I also try my best to avoid using stackoverlow and google for answers, and instead
                    prefer to refer official documentations.
                </p>
